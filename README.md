# Websraping-Shop-List
Web Scraping – Shop List

This project was inspired by a freelance job post I came across online that involved web scraping. Since it offered a great learning opportunity, I decided to build this project to practice and strengthen my Python web scraping skills.

Using BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Pandas, this script scrapes shop-related data from a website and stores the results in a CSV file for easy analysis and reuse.

📌 Features

The scraper collects the following information for each shop:

Shop Name

Shop Type

Short Description

Shop Image URL

All scraped data is saved into a structured CSV file.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

BeautifulSoup – for parsing HTML

Requests – for making HTTP requests

Pandas – for data cleaning and CSV export

📂 Output

The final output is a CSV file containing all extracted shop details in tabular format, making it easy to analyze or integrate into other applications.

🎯 Purpose

Practice real-world web scraping

Learn how to work with HTML structures

Gain experience handling scraped data with Pandas

Simulate a freelance-style project workflow
